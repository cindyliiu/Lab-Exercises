        <h1>Best RA Staff at Binghamton University</h1>
        <div id="about-me">
            <p class="big-text">Hi! My name is <b>Cindy Liu</b> and I am an RA for <strong>CIW Oneida Hall</strong>. To get straight to the point, I am here to explain why my building has the best RA staff relative to the other residence halls on campus. And respectfully no, this  is not up for debate. </p>
        
        <h3>General Information</h3>
            <p>Oneida Hall houses roughly 290 first year students who are overseen by 10 RAs. <br>The student staff is composed of 7 new RAs and 3 returning RAs who each bring their own flair to the team ranging from dry humor to high energy. <br>More information on the building can be found on the <a href="https://www.binghamton.edu/residential-life/communities/ciw/oneida.html">Residential Life webpage</a> and in the video below.</p>

        <h3>Meet the Staff</h1>

            <p>No words are needed to describe the photo. What other staff would be willingly pied in the face with shaving cream and whipped cream and ruin their Residential Life shirts, at no costs for residents? I am waiting. </p>
            <p>The staff with their respective floor assignments are</p>
            <ul>
                <li>2 A-L: Jacey</li>
                <li>2 M-X: Damian</li>
                <li>3 A-L: Matt</li>
